            Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
            Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website
            that a user does not want to have his or her online activity
            tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT
            signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain
            information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT
            option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many
            businesses, including Cube, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
